## The separation between the profiles.yml and dbt_project.yml
1. Purpose of dbt_project.yml  
dbt_project.yml is the configuration file for your dbt project itself. It defines high-level information such as:

Project name and version
Directory structure: Locations for models, tests, sources, and other resources.
Materializations (how dbt should store the results of models—whether as tables, views, or incremental models).
Configurations for models, sources, and tests: Defaults for models, which schemas and databases to use, and configurations for specific transformations or operations.

2. Purpose of profiles.yml:  

profiles.yml is specifically used for defining your connection profiles. It contains environment-specific information that dbt needs to connect to your databases, including credentials and connection details. You can think of profiles.yml as the place for database connection settings, while dbt_project.yml is for project-specific configurations.

Key things profiles.yml defines:

Database connections (e.g., MySQL, Postgres, Snowflake)
Schemas and credentials: Each environment can have different credentials and connection information (e.g., dev, prod).
Target environments: Define multiple environments and specify which one dbt should use for running models (e.g., development vs. production).

## Why Can't dbt_project.yml Suffice?  
1. Separation of Concerns (Security):

profiles.yml is designed to handle sensitive information, such as credentials, passwords, and server information. It allows you to keep connection details separate from the project logic, reducing the risk of exposing sensitive information (especially in version-controlled repositories).
You wouldn’t want to store database connection details (e.g., passwords, usernames) inside dbt_project.yml, as that would expose sensitive data when sharing your project.

2. Multiple Environments:

In a typical dbt project, you might have different environments (e.g., dev, prod, staging), each with its own connection details.
dbt_project.yml doesn’t have a mechanism for managing these environments. The profiles.yml file allows you to define multiple environments with their specific connection details, and then you can easily switch between them using the --target flag.
For example, you may want to connect to a production database for deployment but a local development database for testing. With profiles.yml, you can easily manage this.

3. Scalability and Flexibility:

As your dbt project grows or if it needs to connect to multiple databases (e.g., Snowflake for analytics and MySQL for raw transactional data), the profiles.yml keeps these configurations modular and separated.
Each profile can be configured with unique settings for different environments without cluttering your project configuration (dbt_project.yml).

4. dbt's Design Philosophy:

dbt was designed to keep project-specific configurations (dbt_project.yml) separate from environment-specific configurations (profiles.yml).
dbt_project.yml handles how dbt behaves (model paths, materializations, etc.), while profiles.yml handles how dbt connects to the database.   

To Summarize:
dbt_project.yml: Configures your dbt project (how the project works, where things are located, materializations, etc.).
profiles.yml: Contains the database connection details and environment-specific configurations, ensuring flexibility in connecting to different databases or environments.
This separation ensures that the two parts of dbt—project configurations and database connections—remain modular, secure, and scalable.    

##  How dbt Finds Models in Subfolders
dbt automatically recognizes all the .sql files in the models/ directory, regardless of how they are organized into subfolders. When you run a dbt command, it will:

Look for models in all subdirectories under the models/ folder.
Resolve all dependencies defined with ref() between models, even if they are in different subdirectories.  
 
## Best Practices for Organizing Models  
Staging models: Place all raw or initial transformation models (e.g., from raw sources) in a staging folder.  
Intermediate models: Create an intermediate folder for models that perform transformations between staging and marts.  
Marts: Place reporting or business-level models in a marts folder.  
Testing and documentation: Consider separate folders for tests, docs, and seeds (if used).  

## Purpose of ref() in dbt
2. Why ref('raw_orders') and not orders?  
In dbt, a model is typically a SQL file located in the models/ folder. When you run dbt run, dbt compiles the SQL code in each model and runs it to create tables or views.
The table raw_orders likely refers to another model in your dbt project (not an actual table in the database). So, raw_orders is a model that you have defined earlier in your dbt project, and ref('raw_orders') will create a reference to that model.  
3. Table vs Model  
If you are referring to a physical table in your database (i.e., one that already exists before running dbt), you would use its actual name (e.g., orders).
However, when you reference {{ ref('raw_orders') }}, you're telling dbt to refer to a model named raw_orders that may exist in your models/ folder. The table/view that dbt creates for this model will be named raw_orders, and dbt will automatically create a dependency to build that model before using it in other models.  
4. Why Use ref() Instead of Direct Table Name?  
Using ref() has a few advantages:  

Dependency management: dbt knows that cleaned_orders depends on raw_orders and will build the models in the correct order.
Cross-environment compatibility: When using ref(), dbt ensures that it refers to the correct schema and table for the current environment (e.g., dev, prod).  
#### Avoid hard-coding table names: Using ref() ensures that you are always referencing the correct table created by dbt, even if the actual table name changes due to configurations or renaming. For example, dbt might prepend the schema (e.g., dev_raw_orders or prod_raw_orders).
